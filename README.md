======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bytom/bytom.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Bytom/bytom) [![AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-AGPL%20v3-brightgreen.svg)](./LICENSE)

**Official golang implementation of the Bytom protocol.**

Automated builds are available for stable releases and the unstable master branch. Binary archives are published at https://github.com/Bytom/bytom/releases.

## What is Bytom?

Bytom is software designed to operate and connect to highly scalable blockchain networks confirming to the Bytom Blockchain Protocol, which allows partipicants to define, issue and transfer digitial assets on a multi-asset shared ledger. Please refer to the [White Paper](https://github.com/Bytom/wiki/blob/master/White-Paper/%E6%AF%94%E5%8E%9F%E9%93%BE%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E4%B9%A6-%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E7%89%88.md) for more details.

In the current state `bytom` is able to:

- Manage key, account as well as asset
- Send transactions, i.e., issue, spend and retire asset

## Installing with Homebrew

```
brew tap bytom/bytom && brew install bytom
```

## Building from source

### Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.8 or higher, with `$GOPATH` set to your preferred directory

### Installation

Ensure Go with the supported version is installed properly:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

- Get the source code

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Bytom/bytom.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/bytom/bytom
```

- Build source code

``` bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/bytom/bytom
$ make bytomd    # build bytomd
$ make bytomcli  # build bytomcli
```

When successfully building the project, the `bytomd` and `bytomcli` binary should be present in `cmd/bytomd` and `cmd/bytomcli` directory, respectively.

### Executables

The Bytom project comes with several executables found in the `cmd` directory.

| Command      | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **bytomd**   | bytomd command can help to initialize and launch bytom domain by custom parameters. `bytomd --help` for command line options. |
| **bytomcli** | Our main Bytom CLI client. It is the entry point into the Bytom network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node archive node (retaining all historical state). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Bytom network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `bytomcli --help` and the [bytomcli Wiki page](https://github.com/Bytom/bytom/wiki/Command-Line-Options) for command line options. |

## Running bytom

Currently, bytom is still in active development and a ton of work needs to be done, but we also provide the following content for these eager to do something with `bytom`. This section won't cover all the commands of `bytomd` and `bytomcli` at length, for more information, please the help of every command, e.g., `bytomcli help`.

### Initialize

First of all, initialize the node:

```bash
$ cd ./cmd/bytomd
$ ./bytomd init --chain_id mainnet
```

There are three options for the flag `--chain_id`:

- `mainnet`: connect to the mainnet.
- `testnet`: connect to the testnet wisdom.
- `solonet`: standalone mode.

After that, you'll see `config.toml` generated, then launch the node.

### launch

``` bash
$ ./bytomd node
```

available flags for `bytomd node`:

```

Given the `bytomd` node is running, the general workflow is as follows:

- create key, then you can create account and asset.
- send transaction, i.e., build, sign and submit transaction.
- query all kinds of information, let's say, avaliable key, account, key, balances, transactions, etc.

__simd feature:__

You could enable the _simd_ feature to speed up the _PoW_ verification (e.g., during mining and block verification) by simply:
```
bytomd node --simd.enable
```

To enable this feature you will need to compile from the source code by yourself, and `make bytomd-simd`. 

What is more,

+ if you are using _Mac_, please make sure _llvm_ is installed by `brew install llvm`.
+ if you are using _Windows_, please make sure _mingw-w64_ is installed and set up the _PATH_ environment variable accordingly.
